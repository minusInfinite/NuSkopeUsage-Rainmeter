# NuSkopeUsage-Rainmeter
Rainmeter Skin for extracting NuSkope Usage information

NuSkope - Internet Usage Meter based on BigPond - Internet Usage Meter by kanine (Whirlpool Forums) - http://whrl.pl/RdeJE2

# Installation
1) Install Rainmeter from www.rainmeter.net
2) Download the latest rmskin file from https://github.com/minusInfinite/NuSkopeUsage-Rainmeter/
3) Open the file in Explorer to automatically import

# Usage
1) Load the NuskopeDownload skin, on first run this will prompt to enter your API Token. You can get this from https://members.nuskope.com.au/usage
2) Load the NuskopeUpload skin to also track upload

Notes
- The "NuskopeDownload" Module is the only one that will trigger the script to reduce API call and limit hitting the lockout 

- The first time loading may show some old data, this will be refreshed in 60s if the script is functioning correctly. The Nuskope Usage API is polled every 15 minutes with the default skin configuration.
