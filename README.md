# Installation
1) Install Rainmeter from www.rainmeter.net
2) Download the latest rmskin file from https://github.com/minusInfinite/NuSkopeUsage-Rainmeter/releases
3) Open the file in Explorer to automatically import

# Usage
1) Load the NuskopeCombined skin, on first run this will prompt to enter your API Token. You can get this from https://members.nuskope.com.au/usage
2) If you have a split usage plan you can also use NuskopeDownload and NuskopeUpload

Notes

- The first time loading may show some old data, this will be refreshed in 60s if the script is functioning correctly. The Nuskope Usage API is polled every 15 minutes with the default skin configuration.

# To Do 
 
 - Migrate the skin to use Lua rather than VBS
 - Look to make a dropout or a daily/monthly histogram meter
